val reflect :
  Location.t -> string -> Common.lang * (module Sigs_reflected.S)
(** When given either [Markup.Ns.html] or [Markup.Ns.svg] as argument, evaluates
    to the title of the corresponding markup language, the name of the run-time
    module containing its TyXML implementation, and a preprocessing-time module
    containing reflection information. *)

val get : Common.lang -> (module Sigs_reflected.S)
(** Similar to {!reflect} but takes a {!Common.lang} directly. *)

val to_lang : Location.t -> string -> Common.lang
(** Takes a namespace and returns the appropriate language. *)
