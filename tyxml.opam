synopsis: "A library for building correct HTML and SVG documents"
description:
  "TyXML provides a set of convenient combinators that uses the OCaml type system to ensure the validity of the generated documents. TyXML can be used with any representation of HTML and SVG: the textual one, provided directly by this package, or DOM trees (`js_of_ocaml-tyxml`) virtual DOM (`virtual-dom`) and reactive or replicated trees (`eliom`). You can also create your own representation and use it to instantiate a new set of combinators."
